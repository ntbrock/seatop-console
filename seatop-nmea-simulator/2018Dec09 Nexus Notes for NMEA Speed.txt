My session this coming Sunday:

- Wire this air laptop -> rs232, receieve data to local kplex, visualize with Polar Navy
	(The air is the temporary pi)
	Position from seatalkNG
	Depth, hdm , hdt from Nexus

- Send navigation commands from PolarView -> kplex -> back to nexus, see those displayed on instruments.
	Nx2 display at nav station should show target

- Run the simulator python on the laptop , transmit three sentences through kplex to the nexus.

	\c:1544396165*53\$PSILCD1,359.4,359.6,*1e

- Test: Does Sea temperature display?   68F

- Reconfigure C73 to get Nexus to display simulated BSP from Air python
	Should see bsp count up, while the HDM / HDT remain from nx2 fluxgate

 -Test: Does the simulated boatspeed display?   Do real or simualated HDM/HDT show?

- Do the special functions to show the target speed / angles on the nx2 displays
	Enticing!!!

- Change c73 back to get the paddlewheel log.

- Wire the 12V -> 5V pi power inline with the instrument circuit
	Attach at switch or at Nx2 server?
	Figure out mounting arrangement / case / brackets
	In case:
		Pi2/3
		12v->5v buck converter
		rs232 hat
	Cables out of case
		rs232 to nx2 server
		power cable
		usb extension for Wifi dongle? (to place strategically)
		Optional: Display cable?

	Any room or desire for a Pi screen on the instrumnet panel?
		Might be super cool


- Try the pi rs232 shield (if it arrives)
	Turn off gpio boot up
	Follow the howto's on product websites,  wiring + rpi config + /etc changes

- Pi bootup sequence , (on instrument circuit), with kplex, auto registering the rs232 via gpio.  Auto log to filesystem.
	
- Note, the final design in January will use RTC onboard rpi

- Make the decision to purchase the sonic speedo w/ temp NOW, or wait until future when the old one fails.




GPS receiver:

  Product ID:	0x2303
  Vendor ID:	0x067b  (Prolific Technology, Inc.)
  Version:	4.00
  Speed:	Up to 12 Mb/sec
  Manufacturer:	Prolific Technology Inc. 
  Location ID:	0x14200000 / 9
  Current Available (mA):	500
  Current Required (mA):	100
  Extra Operating Current (mA):	0


  

  Note b: Make sure the calibration codes C73, C74, C75 and C76 (See Multi Control
Manual) for NMEA transducers are correctly set. 



12.6.4 C73 (OFF BSP)
(OFF) = NX2 log transducer. (On) = NMEA log transducer.
If you want to use a NMEA transducer (connected to the NMEA input, you have to set
C73 to On. The Server will then transmit this information on the Nexus Network to all
connected instruments.
After you have changed this setting, you have to restart the system 




2.11 Special NMEA sentences
The Server can read 2 special NMEA sentences which can be send from a PC.
One contains TBS (target boat speed), the other CAD (customised angle data )
and CFD (customised fixpoint data ). These 3 data are retransmitted on the
Nexus Network and can be displayed as a sub-function on the Multi Control
instrument.
To get the sub-function TBS, select main function SPEED and the ”empty” subfunction.Then press PAGE and SET together followed by CLEAR.
To get the sub-function CAD, select main function NAVIGATE and the ”empty”
sub-function.Then press PAGE and SET together followed by CLEAR.
To get the sub-function CFD, select main function WIND and the ”empty” subfunction.Then press PAGE and SET together followed by CLEAR.
